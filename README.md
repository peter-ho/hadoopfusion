fusion-based hadoop for fault tolerance

Replication is a common solution for fault-tolerance in distributed systems. It can be the simplest solution but can be expensive in terms of storage space, computing cycles, and time. Fusion-based DFSMs was introduced in [1]. As an extension, this paper focuses on applying fusion in hadoop to improve fault tolerance.
